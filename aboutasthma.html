            <h1>Asthma Fast Facts:</h1>
            <div class="report-list">
                <li>Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the lung airways. Common symptoms include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, or shortness of breath.</li> 
                <li>About 17.7 million adults have asthma, which is about 7.4 percent of the population.</li>
                <li>The estimated economic annual of asthma is about $56 billion (National Surveillance of Asthma: United States, 2001-2010. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_035.pdf. (Retrieved November 16 2015)</li>
                <li>Allergens or other irritating things can trigger asthma symptoms, including dust, pet danger, perfume, tobacco smoke, chemical irritants, and weather contributes too, including extremely dry, wet, or windy weather. Other factors are the quality of city air and indoor allergens.</li>
                <li>Emotional stress and physical exercise can also be triggers in some people with asthma.</li>
                <li>There are two types of medications: long-term control medication and quick-relief medications. Long-term control medications are preventive, taken daily to achieve and maintain control of asthma symptoms. Quick-relief medications are used to treat asthma attacks. They relieve symptoms rapidly and are taken on an as-needed basis.</li>
